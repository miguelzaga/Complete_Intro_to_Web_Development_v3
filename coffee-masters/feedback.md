## HTML
- I did not place an alt attribute in the logo image.
- I could have used the section tag for each importan div.
- I liked the input group that Brian showed in the course, I could look for similar designs for inputs.
- For the subtotal part, it makes complete sense to use a table tag. I might use it for future designs.

## CSS
- Maybe not use a body class tag an-d just remove the margins and padding on the body tag.
- I could have used grid for the main part like Brian, but I don't mind that much.
- I don't understand shadow box yet, I should look into it.
